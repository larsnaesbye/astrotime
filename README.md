## Tempus
Tempus is a Free and Open Source utility for displaying time in various time systems, mainly for astronomical purposes.

It was written for the [Distro Astro](http://distroastro.org) Linux distribution in C++ using the Qt user interface toolkit for maximum compatibility in case someone wishes to port it to other platforms.
It also serves as my first excursion into linking against the Qt user interface framework.

It is intended to be small and unobtrusive, unless you want it to be. There's a manual in there as well.

You'll be needing Qt 5 or newer for it to work.
