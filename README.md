## Tempus
Tempus is a Free and Open Source utility for displaying time in various time systems, mainly for astronomical purposes.

It uses the Qt user interface toolkit for maximum compatibility in case someone wishes to port it to other platforms.
It also serves as my first excursion into linking against the Qt user interface framework.

Tempus aims to be small and unobtrusive, unless you want it to be. There's a manual included as well.

You'll be needing Qt 5 or newer for it to work.
