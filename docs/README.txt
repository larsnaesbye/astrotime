AstroTime was written specifically for the Distro Astro project to replace the simple Astronomy Clock 2 binary which requires Win32 emulation, and isn't open source. 

It is written by Lars NÃ¦sbye Christensen (http://gaxtrope.net) and its usage is covered under the GNU Public License (GPL) version 3 or any later version.

GPL is included in the accompanying 'gpl-3.0.txt' file.

Possible unilingual name to replace the generic AstroTime could be Chronaster.
