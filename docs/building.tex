\section{Building}

If you wish to build Tempus from scratch, you need to first obtain the source code, which may either be bundled with the application or can be downloaded from Github at https://github.com/larsnaesbye/tempus

You will need a \tt{git} client to make pull requests, and \tt{Qt} version 4 or later installed for compilation to work. In addition you may want to install \tt{Qt Creator}.
