\section{Building}

If you wish to build Tempus from scratch, you need to obtain the C++ source code and related files, which may either be bundled with the application or can be obtained from GitHub by cloning:

\texttt{git clone https://github.com/larsnaesbye/tempus.git}

For this, you will need a \texttt{git} client to make pull requests, and \texttt{Qt} version 5 or later (5.5 or later greatly preferred) installed for compilation to work. 
You need to run the \texttt{qmake} tool (part of \texttt{Qt}) to be able to compile the application properly. In addition you may want to install \texttt{Qt Creator} to edit the base project and forms.
