\section{Building}

If you wish to build Tempus from scratch, you need to first obtain the C++ source code and related files, which may either be bundled with the application or can be obtained from GitHub at https://github.com/larsnaesbye/tempus by cloning:

\texttt{git clone https://github.com/larsnaesbye/tempus.git}

For this, you will need a \texttt{git} client to make pull requests, and \texttt{Qt} version 4 or later (5.5 or later greatly preferred) installed for compilation to work. 
You need to run the qmake tool to be able to compile the application properly.
In addition you may want to install \texttt{Qt Creator} to edit the base project.
