\section{Building}

If you wish to build Tempus from scratch, you need to first obtain the source code, which may either be bundled with the application or can be obtained from Github at https://github.com/larsnaesbye/tempus by forking:

\texttt{git clone https://github.com/larsnaesbye/tempus.git}

For this, you will need a \texttt{git} client to make pull requests, and \texttt{Qt} version 4 or later (5.4 or later preferred) installed for compiling to work. In addition you may want to install \texttt{Qt Creator} to edit the base project.
