\section{Introduction}
Tempus is a Free and Open Source utility for displaying the current time in various time systems for astronomical purposes. It was written for for the Distro Astro Linux distribution in C++ using the \texttt{Qt} user interface toolkit for maximum compatibility in case someone wishes to port it.

It is intended to be small and unobtrusive, unless you want it to be.

A large portion of the calculations and conversions use the AA++ library by PJ Naughter, based on Jean Meeus' book \texttt{Astronomical Algorithms}.
