\section{Introduction}
Tempus is a free and open source utility for displaying the current time in various time systems for astronomical purposes. It is written for Linux systems in C++ using the \texttt{Qt} user interface toolkit for maximum compatibility in case someone wishes to port it.

A large portion of the calculations and conversions use the AA++ library by PJ Naughter, based on Jean Meeus' book \texttt{Astronomical Algorithms}.

Tempus is copyright by Lars N{\ae}sbye Christensen and its usage is covered under the GNU Public License (GPL) version 3 or any later version. GPL license text is included in this document under the appropriate heading.
