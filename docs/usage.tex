\section{Usage}

This section explains a little of the ways you can use Tempus to view the current time.

Tempus runs as an ordinary desktop application, using familiar menus, windows, and controls. It has one window, displaying the time in a scalable view as the central information in big type.

The location obviously affects the time, so Tempus needs to know your location to calculate sidereal times. You can set your location in the \texttt{Location} menu.


\subsection{Formats and standards}

The current time formats supported are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item[\#] Local Mean Time, 12 hour
